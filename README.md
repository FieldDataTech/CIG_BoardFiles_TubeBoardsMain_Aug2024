This zip contains all of the board, library and schematic files for Autodesk Eagle CADsoft to create one of two boards for a tubular solution. 
This two-board solution comprises a battery board and a main board. This repo contains the files for the main board. 
A related repo contains the battery board. The tubular solution can be installed inside of a 2 inch standard PVC pipe. 
Custom 3D printed parts form covers and end caps over the pipe. Autodesk Fusion 360 models for completing the tubular enclosure are in a related repo. 
A related repo contains board files for a functionally identical single board solution that fits into an off-the-shelf waterproof enclosure.
